				resulting in you not only losing the round but also losing all powerups you may have saved
				using a checkpoint â€” specifically, if the coin value hits -2, you lose. You
				additionally lose the ability to recover next round. You also lose a gem or high score point
				for going bankrupt if you have at least one gem. Before you hit this debt value, you will be
				warned so you know that a lot is riding on that question. There is a way out if you have
				enough gems, however: you can use 5 gems to save your checkpoints, although recovery will be
				disabled and you will still lose regardless. However, if you have gotten sufficiently far
				with your checkpoints, spending 5 gems to save them should be an easy decision. Oh, and
				don&#39;t even <i>try</i> refreshing or navigating away, since that will automatically trigger bankruptcy
				as well (we try to do a normal countdown procedure automatically before navigation if your browser
				supports it to try to help you out, but if your browser does not support navigate-away hooks,
				like most browsers on mobile, the app will assume the worst). All links on the game page have
				been set to always open in new tab except the link to this about page from the home page, which
				will open in the same tab unless you are in the middle of the game, to prevent accidental bankruptcy.</i></small></div> <div class="s3 svelte-f65lgz"><h3 id="powerups">Powerups</h3> <p>Powerups appear as they become available and include the following:</p> <ul><li>2 coins: 3 seconds of extra time on the current question (default time 10 sec per question)
				- click the coin counter to access this powerup since it does not have a dedicated button;
				the coin indicator will turn yellow when you have enough coins for this powerup</li> <li>10 coins: Increment (by +2 sec) the amount of extra time granted after each answered
				question (default 0 sec)</li> <li>10 coins: Increment (by +1x) the coin multiplier granted after each answered question
				(default 1x)
				<br> <small><i>This does not save in checkpoints, only in recovery.</i></small></li> <li>20 coins: Increment (by +20 sec) the cap on the maximum amount of time you can start with
				after each answered question (default 60 sec)</li> <li>30 coins: Increment (by +1x) the time factor to be multiplied with the amount of time left
				on each question to be added on to the time for the next question (default 0x)</li> <li>50 coins and 25 gems (high score points): Save all of the current powerups in a checkpoint
				so next game you start with those powerups already equipped
				<br> <small><i>Design Note: It might seem weird that you have to give up high score points for this.
						The reason why it is required to give up gems is to prevent people who have reached very
						high levels from just buying a power up, clicking checkpoint, counting down, restarting,
						and doing the same thing over an over again since if they start with the same number of
						initial points determined by their very great high score, they will always have enough
						money to keep going. In contrast, the way this is currently implemented, after a certain
						amount of checkpoints, they will run out of gems and thus not start with enough coins to
						pay for a checkpoint, so they will have to work their way up to getting that high score
						again. However, if you can buy them, checkpoints are worth it, since they help you reach
						higher levels much more easily and make up for the cost. Bankruptcy is another feature
						intended to mitigate abuse and encourage wise spending, and it not only works with
						bankruptcy but also recovery, making it a good additional failsafe.</i></small></li></ul></div> <div class="s4 svelte-f65lgz"><h3 id="recover">Recovery</h3> <ul><li>For 5 gems or high score points, you can recover, which means that you will start the next
				game with the same powerups (including, unlike checkpoints, the same coin multiplier) and
				the same number of coins as you ended with when you died at level one in the last game</li> <li>This feature is only available if you did not go bankrupt, and it only saves once you drop
				back to level one, so don&#39;t try any hacks</li> <li>To remove the annoying part of watching the timer count down and waiting to lose every level
				if you just want to stop playing yet save your recovery data, there is an &quot;I&#39;m Done&quot; button
				that simply disables all buttons and counts down the levels very quickly, and, assuming you
				did not go bankrupt in that process, stores all recovery information after you willingly die
				at level one</li> <li>The &quot;I&#39;m Done&quot; button is the best way to end a game in the middle, instead of just
				refreshing the page, since refreshing triggers bankruptcy to stop people from abusing game
				features)</li> <li>Note that there is the major risk that if you are going to go bankrupt and you still click
				the &quot;I&#39;m Done&quot; button, you will not have the chance to answer more questions to boost
				yourself up out of bankruptcy or to pay the fee to keep you checkpoints</li></ul> <small><i>A common question is why would you recover when there are checkpoints, or vice versa.
				However, each has its pros and cons, and as a strategic player it is up to you to decide.
				Remember, recovery costs 5 gems, while a checkpoint costs 25 gems along with 50 coins.
				However, a checkpoint can be saved at any time during a game, and assuming you do not go
				bankrupt, the powerups saved in a checkpoint can help you in every game just by pressing the
				normal &quot;start&quot; or &quot;restart&quot; button without any additional fee. Moreover, if you have 5 gems,
				you can save your checkpoint from being dissolved by bankruptcy. However, coins are not
				saved in checkpoints (which can sometimes be a good thing if your high score gives you more
				coins), nor are multipliers (which is almost certainly a negative). Meanwhile, with
				recovery, you can only save what you had right before you lost, but you can save coins and
				multipliers too (you <i>have</i> to start with the same number of coins as you ended with when
				you use recovery though, so it can be a bad thing if you bought a lot and did not end with much).
				Recovery only lasts once (i.e. you have to pay every time you want to recover from the last round),
				and bankruptcy is always fatal, but it is much cheaper. So, based on the context, the choice
				is yours. Note that you have to actively save a checkpoint, but can use it for free, while recovery
				data is saved automatically, but you have to pay each time to use it. They accomplish similar
				goals, but in most other ways, they are opposites.</i></small></div></div> <div class="d svelte-f65lgz" data-svelte-h="svelte-1n6bvz6"><h2 id="contribute">How to contribute</h2> <p>Feel free to play around with/contribute to this project if you wish, although if you publish a
