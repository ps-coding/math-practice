# Math Practice
## How to use
### Question types
- Answer addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponent, and root questions
- The questions get harder the more questions you answer
- The difficulty changes at different rates: root and exponent questions increase in number logarithmically while the main four operations increase linearly, yet even then at a different speed

### Scores and coins
- If you don't answer a question in 10 seconds, you move back a level
- If you are on level 1 and you fail to answer the question in time, you lose the game and can restart
- Your high score is saved locally, and you starting number of coins for each round is calculated based on your high score
- You additionally earn a coin for each correct answer and lose a coin for not answering the question in time

## How to run (dev)

- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install` to get the dependencies
- Execute `npm run dev` in the terminal
